# Uncorrelated's Mean Variance Optimizer

From the thread on Bogleheads: [A mean variance framework for portfolio optimization](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=322366)

Here I've added a `requirements.txt` file to make it easier to get running.

## Build Instructions

Create a virtual env if you haven't already:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual env:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
